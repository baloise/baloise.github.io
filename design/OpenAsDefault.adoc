= https://opendefinition.org/[Open] as Default

for the following reasons we use *Open as Default* as a design principle @ Baloise.
This applies in particular but not only to knowledge and https://github.com/baloise[source code].

- contribute to build a trust relationship with customers, partners and colleagues
- engage people and thus https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Need_to_know#Problems_and_criticism[enhance productivity]
- allow efficient collaboration and decision making inside the group 
- increase security: prohibit lazy classification footnote:[_"it's all secret anyhow"_] and identify important assets
- save cost of security infrastructure & life cycle as we only have to guard and review a fraction of assets
- open up to a potential of 7.000.000.000 collaborators - how big is your company ;-)
- benefit from for countless https://github.com/velikanov/opensource-candies[free services for open source software] and open knowledge

== Questions & Answers
*Q:* Won't people be distracted and confused by all this unnecessary information? Won't absorbing it decrease productivity? +
*A:* Yes, absorbing information has a cost. It is an investment into informed decision making, better priorisation, maximizing work not done, building up intrinsic motivation in line with organisation goals

*Q:* Is Open as Default not an inherent security risk, as people might publish information that needs to be secret? Lazy Openness? +
*A:* We all deal with the fact, that we have professional, public and private lives and we should all know what to publish on the internet (social media) or not. Classification errors always occur and we must learn to detect and fix them. Switching the professional default from secret to public may increase the error rate - reducing it is mainly a matter of awareness. Making people aware of their data sharing choices helps them in the professional and private life and is one of the important topics in our digital society.

*Q:* Aren't your business secrets the base of your unique value proposition? How can you give them away? +
*A:* We put open and honest communication with customers, partners and colleagues above any secret algorithm that we would have invented to rule the market. And if we found the the latter - rest assured, we will deviate from our default ;-)
