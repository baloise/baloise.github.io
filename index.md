# Mission Statement

At Baloise, we foster creativity and encourage every team member to invest in improving her personal work environment.
In the context of Gold Cards, we develop code to enhance our daily business, or we simply explore new languages, tools, or concepts out of curiosity. Either way, we want to share this code with you.

All software here was written as a personal effort of the contributors at code camps, hacking sessions, dojos or using gold cards. Looking for real world productivity tools? Want to contribute? This is the place for you!

# The Baloise Scope

Most of us work at Baloise - we have common challenges.
This website is also a dictonary for internal use, so we know what happens at the other end of the floor ;-)
Yes of course, you can use and contribute even if you are not working at the Baloise!
Last but not least Baloise is sponsoring part of the time invested in the projects.
